Version 0.14:
 - added dependency on the Flocq library
 - removed support for the legacy gappa tactic

Version 0.13:
 - added support for REL properties as |r-e| <= b*|e| in the gappa tactic

Version 0.12:

   (support requires Coq 8.2, OCaml 3.11, and Gappa 0.12.0)
 - fixed incompatibility between the tactic and glob dumping
 - improved tactic with respect to redundant or contradictory hypotheses

Version 0.11:

 - improved build system

Version 0.10:
 - fixed an incompatibility with Coq 8.2

Version 0.9:
 - prevented gappa_prepare from computing on non-reducible bounds
 - improved gappa_prepare to deal with equality goal

Version 0.8:
 - added tactic support for calling Gappa from Coq
 - proved *_subset, nzr_of_nzr_rel*, div_xals, div_fi*, addf_*, add_fi?q,
   sub_fi?q, rel_of_equal
 - moved abs_*, *_of_singleton_bnd theorems to ABS predicate
 - moved mul_fi?q, div_filq to REL predicate

Version 0.7:
 - changed coercions to produce user-friendly constants

Version 0.6:
 - proved rewrite_* for constraints on user rewriting rules
 - proved subset_* for half-bounded goals
 - proved intersect_rr, absurd_intersect_rr, and div_rr for relative errors
 - proved addf_* rewriting helpers for relative error of addition
 - moved compose to relative errors
 - adapted to Coq 8.1pl1

 - proved rel_of_fix_float_ne, nzr_of_abs, nzr_of_bnd, bnd_of_nzr_rel,
   rel_of_nzr_bnd, error_of_rel, mul_rr
 - adapted to Coq 8.1

Version 0.4:
 - fixed mul_mibs
