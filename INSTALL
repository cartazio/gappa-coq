Prerequisites
-------------

You will need the Coq proof assistant (>= 8.2) with a Reals theory compiled
in. You will need the Flocq library (http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/) to be
installed too. In order to use the "gappa" tactic, you will also need to
install Gappa.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the GIT repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
GIT, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && make && make install

The environment variable "COQC" can be set to the Coq compiler command. The
configure script defaults to "coqc".

The option "--libdir=DIR" can be set to the directory where the compiled
library files should be installed by "make install". By default, the target
directory is "`$COQC -where`/user-contrib/Gappa".

The files are compiled at a logical location starting with "Gappa". This
default prefix can be removed with the "--disable-prefix" option.
